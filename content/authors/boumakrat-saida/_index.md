Mrs Boumakrat Saïda (Female) is a young animal scientist finalizing her PhD thesis on water productivity in crop - livestock systems with an emphasis on the origins of water and the economics of water uses. She will be associated to the project through an analysis of value chains in smallholder dairy farms and how short suburban circuits selling traditional dairy products might help improving the water productivity in dairy operations.
