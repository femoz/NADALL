Jean Michel Sorba is a sociologist at the Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Développement de l'Elevage (L.R.D.E., UMR SELMET). HIS work aims to understand and support the dynamics of the construction of links that define products in relation to their production conditions. In this perspective, qualifying products contributes to qualify environments in their environmental and human components. His researches are implemented within groups of actors, producers and non-producers, and consumers, for the benefit of several territorial projects with the objective to relocate food production. The methodology includes comprehensive individual and collective interviews close to “living labs” caractheristics.
