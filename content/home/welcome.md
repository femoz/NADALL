**FORRE** is an initiative from the Regional Sustainable Food Systems Research Group (*Forschung für Resiliente und Nachhaltige Regionale Ernährungssysteme*). The research group, led by the Institute of Technology and Natural Resources Management in the Tropics and Subtropics from the TH Köln, works with **partners** from France, Portugal, Algeria, and Egypt to promote high-impact research in Mediterranea countries.  

The group's main tasks are the PRIMA Section 2 Call multi-topics 2021 and the Horizon Europe call. **NADALL**, the group's research project pre-proposal in the Mediterranean region, was recently selected for the second phase of the PRIMA Section 2 Call multi-topics 2021.
