This project focuses on Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. These Mediterranean countries have experienced strong population growth and urbanization rates in the last few decades. In Egypt, for example, the population has quadrupled in the last 60 years.

The strong population and urbanization developments have induced changing consumption preferences and diets towards more meat and dairy products. Policies have responded by promoting more intensified livestock production systems in detriment of the traditional extensive systems of these regions. However, and despite of the apparent advantages of these intensive systems in terms of satisfying the growing demand, it has become clear in recent years that these systems have a heavy environmental footprint causing environmental damage and serious concerns about future developments. Intensive dairy farms require significant amounts of water contributing to groundwater depletion in several arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. 

The average annual rainfall is low and water stress constitutes the main limiting production factor in these regions. These disadvantageous climatic conditions have always been a constraint on farming systems profitability in the region, and are now strongly exacerbated by ongoing impacts of climate change.  Another major concern of conventional intensive systems is the over-use of fertilizers and pesticides for fodder production, where pesticides residues contaminate milk, posing a threat for public health. 

Conventional intensification pathways do not deliver sustainable solutions for small dairy farmers; they bring too many environmental impacts and a burden of economic risks, i.e., external dependencies, increasing costs and supply uncertainties. 

A paradigm change is needed for more sustainable agricultural production systems. Integrative agroecological frameworks based on territorial approaches are feasible alternatives for the needed transition.
