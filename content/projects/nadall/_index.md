<p style='text-align: justify;'>NADALL Project aims to contribute to a supported effective transition to agroecological intensified dairy farming systems and more sustainable food systems in the Mediterranean North African region.</p> 

The project’s objective framework is in-line with most important international initiatives regarding the promotion of agroecology and sustainable transition pathways for more sustainable food systems. It is particularly in-line with the new EU “[Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)” as the EU new growth strategy for a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, especially with the hereafter resulting EU strategies “[Farm to Fork](https://ec.europa.eu/food/horizontal-topics/farm-fork-strategy_en)” and “[Biodiversity 2030](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en)” that can be seen as lighthouse towards more fair, healthy and environmental-friendly food systems to protect nature and reverse environmental degradation.

The objective’s framework of this project agrees with these strategies and sharing the urgent need to reduce the dependency on chemical fertilizers and usage of pesticides, and increase ecosystem-based farming, improve animal welfare, and curb biodiversity loss in the Mediterranean North African region. Moreover, this project is as well aware of EU initiatives such as the [European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL)](https://enoll.org/), and aims at connecting NADALL with ENoLL. 

In this context NADALL will as well connect with ongoing [H2020 projects](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-sections-projects), where partners of this consortium are involved, like: (i) the NEFERTITI project (https://nefertiti-h2020.eu/), which has established an EU-wide network of demonstration and pilot farms designed to enhance knowledge exchanges on important issues of sustainable livestock systems; and (ii) the MIXED project (Multi-actor and transdisciplinary development of efficient and resilient MIXED farming and agroforestry-systems), dealing with methods that increase efficiency and resilience to climate change and reduce emissions (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/862357).
