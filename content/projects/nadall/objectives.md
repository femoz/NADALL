<p style='text-align: justify;'>The overall objective of this project is to contribute to a supported effective transition to agroecological intensified dairy farming systems and more sustainable food systems in the Mediterranean North African region </p>

In this framework, the specific objectives of the project are to:	

1.	 Implement a network of Mediterranean North African Dairy Agroecological Living Labs (NADALL), as a cooperative dairy innovation platform for sharing experiences and developing co-research and evidence on agroecological dairy farming systems, for effective transitions towards sustainable food systems.</br>
</br>
2.	Implement a “Co-research Hub” in each Dairy Agroecological Living Lab (DALL) connecting scientists with local selected farmers and extension officers and further stakeholders in designing, testing and validating promising agroecological practices, as well as connecting scientists and communities across the three countries of the project.</br>
</br>
    The NADALL network will start its Co-research activities by concentrating on the following specific core research objectives:
    </br>  
    2.1	Characterize the dairy production systems and milksheds in the context of the three project regions;</br>
    </br>  
    2.2	Locally adapt promising agroecological practices in milk production systems for reducing or eliminating the usage of external synthetic inputs, enhancing the recycling potentials of renewable resources, and closing as far as possible resource cycles of nutrients and biomass and increase farms feed autonomy;</br>
 </br>  
    2.3	Develop innovative business models for connecting small producers and consumers informed on agroecological dairy products.
</br>
3.	Implement a “Science-Policy-Society Interface (SPS-Interface)” in each DALL aiming at upscaling and outscaling results. Promotion is done though evidence about the benefits of agroecological practices and establishment of an enduring cooperation between academia, policy, and society, for participatory and informed policy-making and societal changes.</br>
    </br>
    3.1	Upscale created evidence on the economic feasibility of the agroecological transition;</br> 
    </br>
    3.2	Design suitable policy actions and fiscal measures for supporting the transition to agroecology based sustainable food systems;</br> 
    </br>
    3.3	Promote a regional Virtual Research Infrastructure for providing services to the NADALL network to conduct co-research on agroecological innovations;</br> 
    </br>
    3.4	Establish connection between NADALL and the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL).</br>
</br>
4.	Implement a “Capacity Development Center (CDC)” in each DALL for enhancing the professional skills of local stakeholders towards the development of local agroecological dairy value chains:</br>
   	</br>
  	4.1	Capacitate “innovation brokers” (extension services and selected breeders) on innovative agroecological practices for mix-production systems;</br> 
    </br>
    4.2	Capacitate extension services, and selected breeders, traders, on business management.</br>
