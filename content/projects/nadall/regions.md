<p style='text-align: justify;'>This project focuses on North African Mediterranean countries; Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. These countries have experienced  strong  population  growth  and  urbanization  rates  in  the  last  few  decades.  Morocco’s  population  has  increased from 12.3 million in 1960 to over 36.0 million in 2018. The population growth in Algeria has been even higher, from 11.0 million in 1960 to 42.2 million in 2018. In Egypt, the population has quadrupled during the last 60 years,  counting  around  100  million  inhabitants  in  2020 (Capmas  2021;  World  Bank  2021a,  2021b).  The  strong  population and urbanization developments have induced changes in consumption preferences and diets towards an increase in meat and dairy products consumptions, a challenge given the disadvantageous climatic conditions of the region (Sraïri et al. 2013). Average annual rainfall is low, and water stress constitutes the main limiting factor, with strong  disparities  among  regions  (WRI  2021). These harsh  climatic  conditions  have  always  been  a  constraint  on  farming  systems  profitability  in  the  region  and  are  now  strongly  exacerbated  by  the ongoing  impacts  of  climate  change.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Milk in  the  region is  mostly  produced  in  mixed  crop-livestock  smallholder  farms,  with  a  minority  of  large-scale specialized dairy farms. Given the low productivity of natural pastures, dairy cattle and small ruminant feeding is complex and requires the use of fodders and concentrate feeds (conventional systems). Moreover, the majority of the small-holders practice mixed systems of milk and meat production, and there are strong trade-offs with regards to fodder allocation to animals of both systems. Farmers cultivate forages in various contexts (rain-fed fields, fallows, or irrigated schemes) and try to make use of natural grass and crop residues produced on-farm. They basically try to complement on-farm feed resources with two types of off-farm feed options: i) cereal grains, crop by-products, and protein  concentrates;  and  ii)  the  incorporation  of  lignified  poor  roughages  at  high  levels  in  dietary  rations.  These  options have serious limitations: (1) the high prices of off-farm feed jeopardize farm’s profitability given stagnating farm gate milk prices; (2) the use of straws and poor roughages (lignified oat hay) in dry seasons may decrease milk yield  significantly.  In  fact,  there  is  strong  evidence  that  milk  yield  often  decreases  dramatically  during  the  dry  seasons,  as  farmers  are  not  well  aware  of  the  techniques  of  dietary  rations  complementation  and  they  even  often  ignore their cattle’s requirements (Boukhechem et al. 2019; Sraïri and Kessab 1998; Annicchiarico et al. 2005).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Policy interventions have mostly promoted conventional intensification of livestock production systems at the cost of the traditional extensive systems in these regions. Despite the apparent advantages of these intensive systems in terms  of  satisfying  a  growing  demand,  it  has  become  clear  in  recent  years  that  these  systems  have  a  heavy  environmental  footprint  causing  environmental  damage  and  serious  concerns  about sustainable development. Conventional intensive dairy farms require significant amounts of water, contributing to groundwater depletion in arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Another  major  concern  of  conventional  intensive  systems  is  the  contamination  of  milk  through  the  over-use  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  for  fodder  production  and  over-use  of  antibiotics,  posing  a  threat  to  public  health.  Conventional  intensification  pathways  do  not  deliver  sustainable  solutions  for  small  dairy  farmers;  they  bring  too  many environmental impacts and burden of economic risks, i.e., external dependencies, increasing costs, and supply uncertainties (Sraïri 2011; Sraïri et al. 2013). Integrative frameworks are needed, in territorial contexts, drawing on biodiversity-based agriculture and agroecological transitions at the local level (Duru et al. 2015).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In such a context, it is clear that a paradigm change is needed for more sustainable agricultural production systemsin  the  region.  Integrative  agroecological  frameworks  based  on  farm  and/or  territorial  approaches  are  feasible  alternatives  for  the  needed  transition.  Agroecology  principles  and  practices  have  long  been  recognized  as  an  integrative framework for an effective transition to sustainable food and agricultural systems. In this context, reducing or replacing external chemical inputs (e.g., synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) can be done by re-diversifying farming systems and it enhancing the delivery of ecosystem services. Crop diversity strategies (crop rotations and inclusion of  nitrogen-fixing  legumes)  can  directly  increase  the  nitrogen  pool  in  the  soil  and  reduce  pest  incidences.  Crop  livestock integration, besides reducing the risk of raising a single product, can reduce external fertilizer use through nutrient cycling, and support soil conservation practices that increased water retention capacities, resistance to soil erosion,  and  increase  soil  organic  C  (Bonaudo  et  al.  2014;  Dumont  and  Bernués  2014;  Dumont  et  al.  2013;  FAO  2018; Vaarst et al. 2018; Wezel et al. 2009; Wezel et al. 2020).</p>
