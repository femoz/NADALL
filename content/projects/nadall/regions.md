<p style='text-align: justify;'>This project focuses on North African Mediterrranean contries; Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. These countries have experienced strong population growth and urbanization rates in the last few decades. Morocco’s population has increased from 12.3 million in 1960 to over 36.0 million in 2018. The population growth in Algeria has been even higher from 11.0 million in 1960 to 42.2 million in 2018. In Egypt, the population has quadrupled during the last 60 years, counting around 100 million inhabitants in 2020 (Capmas 2021; World Bank 2021a, 2021b). The strong population and urbanization developments have induced changing in consumption preferences and diets towards more meat and dairy products, a challenge given the disadvantageous climatic conditions of the region. (Sraïri et al. 2013). Average annual rainfall is low and water stress constitutes the main limiting factor, with strong disparities among regions (WRI 2021).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>These harsh climatic conditions have always been constraint on farming systems profitability in the region, and are now strongly exacerbated by ongoing impacts of climate change. Milk production in the region is mostly produced in mixed crop-livestock smallholder farms, with minority of large-scale specialized dairy farms. Given the low productivity of natural pastures, dairy cattle feeding is complex and requires the use of fodders and concentrate feeds. Moreover, the majority of the small-holders practice mixed systems of milk and meat production, and there are strong trade-offs with regards to fodder allocation to animals of both. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Farmers cultivate forages in various context (rain-fed fields, fallows, or irrigated schemes) and try to make use of natural grass and crop residues produced on-farm. They basically complement those on-farm feed resources with two types of off-farm feed options: i) cereal grains, crop by-products, and proteaginous meals; and ii) the incorporation of lignified poor roughages at high levels in dietary rations. These options have serious limitations: (1) the high prices of off-farm feed jeopardize farm’s profitability given stagnating farm gate milk prices; (2) the use of cereal straws and poor roughages (lignified oat hay) in dry seasons may also decrease milk yield significantly. In fact, there is strong evidence that milk yield often decreases dramatically during the dry seasons, as farmers are not well aware of the techniques of dietary rations complementation and they even often ignore their cattle’s requirements (Boukhechem et al. 2019; Sraïri and Kessab 1998; Annicchiarico et al. 2005).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Policy interventions have mostly promoted conventional intensification of livestock production systems at the cost of the traditional extensive systems in these regions. Despite of the apparent advantages of these intensive systems in terms of satisfying the growing demand, it has become clear in recent years that these systems have a heavy environmental footprint causing environmental damage and serious concerns about development. Intensive dairy farms require significant amounts of water to contribute to groundwater depletion in arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Another major concern of conventional intensive systems is the over-use of fertilizers and pesticides for fodder production, where pesticides residues contaminate milk, posing a threat for public health. Conventional intensification pathways do not deliver sustainable solutions for small dairy farmers; they bring too many environmental impacts and burden of economic risks, i.e., external dependencies, increasing costs and supply uncertainties (Sraïri 2011; Sraïri et al. 2013). Integrative frameworks are needed, in territorial contexts, drawing on biodiversity-based agriculture, and agroecological transitions at the local level (Duru et al. 2015).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Against this background it seems clear that a paradigm change is needed for more sustainable agricultural production systems in the region. Integrative agroecological frameworks based on territorial approaches are feasible alternatives for the needed transition. Agroecology principles and practices have long been recognized as an integrative framework for effective transition to sustainable food and agricultural systems. In this context, reducing or replacing external chemical inputs (e.g., synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) can be done by re-diversifying farming systems and with enhancing the delivery of ecosystem services. Crop diversity strategies (crop rotations and inclusion of nitrogen-fixing legumes) can directly increase the nitrogen pool in the soil, and reduce pest incidences. Crop livestock integration (CLI) besides reducing the risk of raising a single product, can reduce external fertilizer use through nutrient cycling, and support soil conservation practices that increased water retention capacities, resistance to soil erosion, and increase soil organic C (Bonaudo et al. 2014; Dumont and Bernués 2014; Dumont et al. 2013; FAO 2018; Vaarst et al. 2018; Wezel et al. 2009; Wezel et al. 2020).</p>
