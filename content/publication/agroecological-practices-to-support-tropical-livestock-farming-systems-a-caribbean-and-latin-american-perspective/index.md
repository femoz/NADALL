abstract: "With global climate changes currently occurring, and particularly
  given the severe energy and food shortages occurring throughout tropical
  regions, agroecological (AE) systems are drawing renewed attention as an
  efficient alternative to intensive models of production, particularly
  unsuitable in regions of the world such as the Caribbean or Latin America.
  There is a pressing need to focus on livestock farming systems (LFS) and
  characterize their potential contributions to global sustainability. A
  multidisciplinary approach is needed to address these multiple and complex
  problems. Traditionally, LFS have shown their sustainability high potential.
  The purpose of this work is to highlight solutions to minimize inputs, by
  describing some success and diverse case studies through the Caribbean. These
  systems were analyzed at different levels: animal/function, farm/family, and
  territory/society. This produced a set of guidelines that help to increase the
  efficiency of tropical systems, particularly those concerned with (1) choosing
  the best-suited genotypes, while enhancing population biodiversity; (2)
  matching the farming system to the available resources, feed, and by-products;
  (3) steering the whole farming system through reproduction management with no
  hormonal treatment, while facilitating system reproducibility and increasing
  performances; (4) controlling health constraints instead of annihilating risks
  and implement an integrated management design to reduce chemical treatments or
  increase the use of nutraceuticals; and (5) mitigating climate constraints by
  using soft techniques. In the second part of this work, some integrated
  systems are described. The Tosoly farm of Colombia, for instance, is conceived
  as a totally integrated crop-livestock system, allowing the additional
  production of energy at the farm level. Thus, it epitomizes the positive
  impact that livestock can exert upon the environment. The case study of Haiti
  indicates how AE practices can help in designing a pro-poor sustainable milk
  production system. It concerns an entire dairy sector built all over the
  country on the basis of micro-units of milk production and processing."
