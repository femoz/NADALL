abstract: "All over the world, farmers have to face up to increasing
  uncertainties (market and climate). They have to adapt their activity to the
  new contexts and challenges of livestock farming (producing more and better,
  and satisfying the expectations of society, consumers, and of downstream
  operators), while at the same time responding to their own expectations in
  terms of income, quality of life, and working conditions. In order to
  understand these changes and consider the future, work organization must be
  taken into account. The Work Assessment Method, developed by French livestock
  researchers, provides a framework able to capture work organization, taking
  into account the specifics of the livestock activity. Based on a comparative
  analysis of nine case studies that used the Work Assessment Method from six
  contrasted countries, this review (1) gives generic ideas on work organization
  indicators and their variation; (2) identifies four generic patterns of work
  organization which are not linked to the local context but marked by the
  workforce composition; (3) demonstrates that the relevance of the Work
  Assessment Method to tackle work issues, and its capacities to be adapted to a
  variety of livestock farming contexts throughout the world, is linked to the
  properties of its framework, which was developed by combining different
  disciplinary approaches; (4) highlights the principal limits of the method:
  lack of coordination with other dimensions of work (labor productivity; sense
  of the job), and limited characterization of the work organization
  flexibility; and (5) proposes some possibilities of change to better respond
  to the diversity of work situations and questions about work, and take better
  into account the evolutions of livestock farming systems."
