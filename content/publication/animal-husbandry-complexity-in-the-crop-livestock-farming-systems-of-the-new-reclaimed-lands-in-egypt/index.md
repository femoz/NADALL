abstract: "In Egypt, the New Reclaimed Lands (NRL) are desert lands that
  surround the Nile delta, which have been developed for irrigated agriculture
  during the last half century. They have been settled by migrants from diverse
  origins, including persons with university degrees and landless peasants from
  the areas of high demographic concentration of the Nile delta and valley. Only
  few papers describe the farming systems of these small holders in NRL,
  especially the animal component, livestock practices, crop-livestock
  integration, performances and diversity. CLIMED Project aims to produce data
  on these themes to describe and understand better NRL crop-livestock systems,
  assess their performances and dynamics in today’s Egyptian and Mediterranean
  context, as well as define priorities in terms of research and development
  policies. We describe the farming systems based on data collected over a year
  during monthly monitoring, with a sample of thirteen farms in three zones,
  selected from a larger survey of 160 farms in four zones. Data show the high
  complexity of these farming systems for three main reasons: the
  multifunctionality of animal production, the high dependency of livestock on
  feeds produced on farm, and social factors such as skills and work management
  at farm level. Directly linked to this complexity, farm monitoring shows the
  huge challenge of development services in the face of local market
  uncertainty, the very limited access to land, future constraints in water
  management, and the little attractiveness of agriculture to young people."
