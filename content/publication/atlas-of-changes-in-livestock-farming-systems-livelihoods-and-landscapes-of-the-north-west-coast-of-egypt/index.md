abstract: 'The Mediterranean basin has faced important changes in its
  environment : (i) urbanization and demographic pressure on natural resources,
  mainly land and water; (ii) increased food demand, and changes in habit and
  culture, and (iii) climate. Due to strong historical and cultural links with
  the natural and social environment of the North Coastal zone of the Western
  Desert in Egypt, livestock activities hold a structural role in the social and
  spatial organization or land use. The exploratory ELVULMED project entitled:
  "Role of livestock activities in the process of adaptation and reducing
  vulnerability of Mediterranean societies facing global changes" aimed at : (i)
  analyzing and understanding the role of livestock activities in reducing the
  vulnerability at the family and territorial levels in the face of global
  change and (ii) identifying the key determinants of adaptive processes in the
  South Mediterranean.'
