abstract: Milk production intensification has led to several unwanted aspects,
  such as sustainability issues and environmental pollution. Among these,
  increased milk outputs that have been achieved over the last 70 years have led
  to several health and pathophysiological conditions in high yielding dairy
  animals, including metabolic diseases that were uncommon in the past.
  Increased occurrence of diverse metabolic diseases in cattle and other
  domestic animals is a key feature of domestication that not only affects the
  animals' health and productivity, but also may have important and adverse
  health impacts on human consumers through the elevated use of drugs and
  antibiotics. These aspects will influence economical and ethical aspects in
  the near future. Therefore, finding and establishing proper biomarkers for
  early detection of metabolic diseases is of great interest. In the present
  review, recent work on the discovery of fitness, stress and welfare biomarkers
  in dairy cows is presented, focusing in particular on possible biomarkers of
  energy balance and oxidative stress in plasma and milk, and biomarkers of
  production-related diseases and decreased fertility.
