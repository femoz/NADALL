abstract: "This study analyzes key factors influencing water productivity in
  cattle rearing, particularly in contexts characterized by water scarcity. This
  was done through year-round monitoring of on-farm practices within five
  smallholder farms located in the Saïss area (northern Morocco). The on-farm
  monitoring protocol consisted of characterizing: (i) volumes of water used for
  fodder production and distinguished by source (rainfall, surface irrigation
  and groundwater), (ii) virtual water contained in off-farm feed resources,
  (iii) total forage biomass production, (iv) dietary rations fed to lactating
  cows and their calves and (v) milk output and live weight gain. Findings
  reveal a mean water footprint of 1.62±0.81 and 8.44±1.09 m3/kg of milk and of
  live weight gain, respectively. Groundwater represented only 13.1% and 2.2% of
  the total water used to get milk and live weight gain, respectively, while
  rainfall represented 53.0% and 48.1% of the total water for milk and live
  weight gain, respectively. The remaining water volumes used came from surface
  irrigation water (7.4% for milk and 4.0% for live weight gain) and from
  virtual water (26.5% for milk and 44.7% for live weight gain). The results
  also revealed a relatively small gross margin per m3 of water used by the
  herd, not exceeding an average value of US $ 0.05, when considering both milk
  and live weight. Given the large variability in farm performances, which
  affect water productivity in cattle rearing throughout the production process,
  we highlight the potential for introducing a series of interventions that are
  aimed at saving water, while concurrently improving efficiency in milk
  production and live weight gain. These interventions should target the chain
  of production functions that are implemented throughout the process of water
  productivity in cattle rearing. Moreover, these interventions are of
  particular importance given our findings that livestock production depends
  largely upon rainfall, rather than groundwater, in an area afflicted with
  sustained droughts, overexploitation of groundwater resources and growing
  water scarcity."
