abstract: Local breeds are recognized as an important element for the
  maintenance of various and specific farming systems. Challenges for local
  breeds’ management, in a context of crossbreeding with exotic highly
  productive breeds, have been mainly studied in tropical countries. However,
  similar situation and challenges are likely to exist in Mediterranean
  countries subjected to climatic and feed scarcity issues. The objective of
  this work is to identify the challenges for local breed management in a
  regional context of informal crossbreeding with highly productive breeds. For
  this purpose, the case of dairy sheep farming in the region of Thessaly, in
  Central Greece, was examined. Semi-structured interviews were performed in 46
  farms and processed through hierarchical classification on principal
  components. A follow-up on seven farms raising the Karagouniko sheep breed,
  the main local breed of the region, was carried on during one milk campaign.
  Results showed that a diversity of breeding strategies involving local
  purebred and crossbred flocks coexist in the region. The Karagouniko breed is
  facing several challenges. The supply in exotic breeding males and their
  crosses could be wide-scaled and involved a diversity of operators, whereas
  the supply in breeding males of Karagouniko breed was restrained to
  between-farm supply among flocks under milk recording scheme. In addition, the
  heterogeneity of access and quality of collective rangelands affected the
  farming of Karagouniko breed ewes, whose purebred flocks were significantly
  associated with the grazing on native grasslands. Finally, unfavorable
  dairies’ policies led Karagouniko farmers to seek higher flock milk production
  through levers that could impact the vulnerability of the farm, such as
  earlier lambing period or earlier weaning age. Farmers also questioned the use
  of highly productive breeds as a potential lever to reach higher flock milk
  production.
