abstract: Ecosystem Services (ES) are climate sensitive, vary by seasons, and
  support the majority of people’s livelihoods in Bangladesh. Our research aimed
  to identify short-term (seasonal) and long-term (2000–2018) qualitative and
  quantitative dependence of rural livelihoods on ES in the southern wetland
  areas of Bangladesh. Primary data were collected through 162 household
  questionnaire surveys conducted in the six sub-districts of southern wetland
  of Bangladesh. The research developed two dependency indexes for two major
  groups of livelihood activities of the study area, known as the Dependency
  Index of Ecosystem Services (DIES) and the Dependency Index of Socio-Economic
  Activities (DISE). The results showed that the majority of the households were
  dependent on different ES-based activities, for example, agriculture, for
  their livelihood. The results further demonstrated that (i) ES-based
  households were predominantly dependent on post-monsoon seasons for a majority
  of their financial benefits, (ii) households had been increasingly reliant on
  diversified Socio-Economic (SE) activities for their financial benefits, and
  (iii) there had been development of gradual income disparities between ES and
  SE livelihood activities. The results suggested that given the potentially
  volatile nature of climatic variables in southern Bangladesh, ES-based
  households might face increasing livelihood risks of crop failure and
  prolonged seasonal poverty in the pre-monsoon seasons. The results also
  implied that diversified non-ES livelihood activities could be an effective
  tool to reduce household’s dependence on already strained local ecosystem
  services. The research also highlighted the necessity of considering the
  seasonality impacts on rural livelihoods for ensuring sustainability of the
  rural social-ecological system against environmental adversaries such as
  climate change.
