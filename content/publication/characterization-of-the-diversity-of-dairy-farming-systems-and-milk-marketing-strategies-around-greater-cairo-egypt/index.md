abstract: The aim of this study was to suggest a methodology to characterize the
  diversity of dairy farming systems in Nile valley lands (NVLs) and newly
  reclaimed lands (NRLs) in Egypt to understand the traditional dairy sector.
  Data were collected from 65 farmers in three villages through three
  consecutive seasons. Interviews and field visits were done at farm level.
  Based on multiple factorial and cluster analyses, six farmer groups were
  identified according to land and livestock assets, milk production and
  selling. Milk marketing was influenced by season, farmers? traditions, and
  market access. Structure highlights the dominance of small scale
  crop-livestock system, farm family depends on milk as a source of protein and
  fat for family food and as a main source of income especially in old lands,
  while in NRLs, there was a higher crop-livestock integration and
  complementarity to cover family and farm expenses, so paid services strategy
  could fit dairy sector in new land. Milk production constitutes a major
  activity in very small land farms, the sustainability of this sector facing
  the lack of technical support and lack of pricing system for milk and
  feedstuffs, where more governmental and non-governmental projects needed to
  supply farmers with high quality forage seeds, high producing animals and
  veterinary services. So, considering the diversity of farming systems, one
  agricultural policy will not fit all farmers? categories. Also, governmental
  and non-governmental services should be reasoned according to the region and
  the season.
