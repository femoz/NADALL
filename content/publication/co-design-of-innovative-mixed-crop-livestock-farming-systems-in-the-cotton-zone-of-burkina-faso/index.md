publication: The agroecological transition of agricultural systems in the Global South.
abstract: Producers in western Burkina Faso have to contend with high rainfall
  variability and very volatile agricultural prices. Such uncertainties have led
  the vast majority of them to diversify their production and practise mixed
  crop-livestock farming using low levels of inputs in order to ensure their
  food self-sufficiency while containing economic risks. Their mixed
  crop-livestock farming systems are based on cotton, cereals (maize, sorghum),
  legumes (groundnuts, cowpeas), and the rearing of cattle and small ruminants.
