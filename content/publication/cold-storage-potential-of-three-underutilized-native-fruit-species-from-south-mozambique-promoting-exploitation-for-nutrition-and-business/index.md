abstract: "The exploitation of underutilized indigenous species from
  agroforestry systems improves the resilience of smallholders' agricultural
  systems. In Mozambique, consumption of native fruits is a strategy used by
  rural populations to obtain food during seasonal periods of critical hunger.
  The inclusion of fruits in the diets has the additional advantage of providing
  nutrients and antioxidants, fighting malnutrition and “hidden hunger”.
  Exploitation of native fruits towards introduction of added value can also
  leverage the creation of new businesses and the development of new
  value-chains. Native fruits are collected and consumed fresh and, during
  surplus periods, are sold in local markets to obtain revenues to buy other
  foods and basic goods. Native fruits are usually not stored for later
  consumption or trade and no knowledge exists on their specific physiology and
  related storage aptitude. In this work, the cold storage potential was
  evaluated in three priority species: Uapaca kirkiana, Strychnos spinosa and S.
  madagascariensis. Under four temperature regimes, -20, 5, 12°C and room
  temperature, the physical-chemical and quality evolution was followed along
  120-d storage. The results disclosed that under >0°C cold storage
  temperatures, U. kirkiana had the lowest conservation capacity, since after 30
  d at 5°C, all fruits were rotten or chilled injured and at 12°C the pulps were
  totally desiccated. After 60 d cold storage at 12°C, Strychnos sp. presented
  ca. 2/3 or 2/5 acceptable fruits, respectively, for S. spinosa and S.
  madagascariensis, disclosing distinct potential for cold preservation. At
  -20°C, fruits from all species could be stored for 120 d, although with
  external symptoms of injury by browning. Nonetheless, pulps were significantly
  less or not affected, particularly in Strychnos. Under freezing, in this
  genus, at 120 d storage, decreased TSS and increased acidity were recorded for
  S. spinosa, while for S. madagascariensis both TSS and pH were lowered."
