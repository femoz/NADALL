abstract: "The quality construction in agro-food chains results from the forms
  of organization and coordination of actors in these sectors. We propose in
  this research to explain the modalities of this construction and the forms of
  coordination between the actors in the case of the dairy sector of the wilaya
  of Médéa in Algeria. We conducted a series of surveys of some actors operating
  in the sector, as well as interviews with officials of the control, regulation
  and supporting institutions. We have applied the theoretical fields of
  convention economics for spotting conventions that allow these actors to
  coordinate and define the quality produced. We conducted these analyzes in the
  industrial sector and the traditional sector. We completed with an analysis of
  the products qualification by the last consumer. The latter was based on a
  survey of consumers of traditional products surveyed in the creamers. Since
  our work is limited to local milk, and the dairy industries only account for
  10% of this milk in their manufacturing process, we have limited ourselves to
  consumers of traditional products that are 100% manufactured local milk. The
  findings are: a variety of forms of coordination of quality during exchanges ;
  collection centers, traditional creamers, and milk factories are the source of
  compromise between conventions of different natures ; dynamics and evolution
  of conventions ; the role of proximity in the qualification of products ; a
  weak implication of the offer in the objectification of the conventional
  references."
