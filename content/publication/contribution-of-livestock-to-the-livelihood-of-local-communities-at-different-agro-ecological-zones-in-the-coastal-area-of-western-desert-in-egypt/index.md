abstract: >-
  he coastal area of Western Desert of Egypt is a hot dry area with less than150
  mm rain- fall and more than370C temperatures in summer. Raising livestock,
  especially sheep and goats, is historically the main socioeconomic activity
  for the local communities (Bedouin). The area, however, has witnessed major
  changes over the last decades; demographic growth, urbanization, tourism
  development and land reclamation in the East, beside prolonged drought from
  1995 - 2010. Three agro ecological zones are characterized in the region; the
  rain-fed area with communal grazing in the West, the newly reclaimed land with
  irrigated farming in the East, and the desert oases in the South. Field survey
  was carried out in 2011 with 182 smaIl ruminant breeders to assess the role of
  livestock in the family net income, and in sustaining their livelihood under
  the prevailing dry conditions. 


  Livestock contribution to the total income of the local community in the rain-fed area differed significantly with flock size; being 28.4% for small breeder, 43.7% for the medium ones and 80.0% for the large breeders, mainly from sheep and goats. In the newly reclaimed lands, it was related to farm size 57.6% for small farms (2 acres) to 70% for large farms (2 acres). Source of income in the desert oasis was very diversified, livestock contribute to the total income of the local community there. Off-farm activities contributed significantly to the family income of the oasis community, and to the smaIl-holders in the rain-fed area while it was minor for medium and large breeders, and in the reclaimed area. Crops (mainly cereals)and fruit trees contributed highly to the income of oases communities, and moderately the small and medium size breeders in the rain-fed and reclaimed land. The breeders' flock contributed significantly to the nutritional status of their families in the three zones, through high domestic consumption for meat and milk.
