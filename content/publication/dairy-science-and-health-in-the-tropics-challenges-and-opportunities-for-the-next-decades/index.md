abstract: "In the next two decades, the world population will increase
  significantly; the majority in the developing countries located in the tropics
  of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. To feed such a population,
  it is necessary to increase the availability of food, particularly high-value
  animal protein foods produced locally, namely meat and dairy products. Dairy
  production in tropical regions has a lot of growth potential, but also poses a
  series of problems, particularly as dairy production systems were developed in
  temperate countries and in most cases are difficult to implement in the
  tropics. Drawbacks include hot weather and heat stress, the lack of
  availability of adequate feeds, poor infrastructure, and cold chain and the
  competition with cheap imports from temperate countries. This position paper
  reviews the major drawbacks in dairy production for the five major dairy
  species: cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel, as well as the future
  trends in research and development. It also concerns the major trends in
  reproduction and production systems and health issues as well as environmental
  concerns, particularly those related to greenhouse gas emissions. Tropical
  Animal Health and Production now launches a topical collection on Tropical
  Dairy Science. We aim to publish interesting and significant papers in
  tropical dairy science. On behalf of the editorial board of the Tropical
  Animal Health and Production, we would like to invite all authors working in
  this field to submit their works on this topic to this topical collection in
  our journal."
