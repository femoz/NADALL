abstract: "Concerns about the negative impacts of productivist agriculture have
  led to the emergence of two forms of ecological modernisation of agriculture.
  The first, efficiency-substitution agriculture, aims to improve input use
  efficiency and to minimise environmental impacts of modern farming systems. It
  is currently the dominant modernisation pathway. The second,
  biodiversity-based agriculture, aims to develop ecosystem services provided by
  biological diversity. It currently exists only as a niche. Here we review
  challenges of implementing biodiversity-based agriculture: managing, at the
  local level, a consistent transition within and among farming systems, supply
  chains and natural resource management. We discuss the strengths and
  weaknesses of existing conceptual frameworks developed to analyse farming,
  social-ecological and socio-technical systems. Then we present an integrative
  framework tailored for structuring analysis of agriculture from the
  perspective of developing a territorial biodiversity-based agriculture. In
  addition, we propose a participatory methodology to design this agroecological
  transition at the local level. This design methodology was developed to
  support a multi-stakeholder arena in analysing the current situation,
  identifying future exogenous changes and designing (1) targeted territorial
  biodiversity-based agriculture, (2) the pathway of the transition and (3) the
  required adaptive governance structures and management strategies. We conclude
  by analysing key challenges of designing such a complex transition, developing
  multi-actor and multi-domain approaches based on a combination of scientific
  and experiential knowledge and on building suitable boundary objects
  (computer-based and conceptual models, indicators, etc.) to assess innovative
  systems designed by stakeholders."
