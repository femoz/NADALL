abstract: "In Central Vietnam, farmers report an increasing occurrence frequency
  of water shortages for irrigation during dry seasons. Particularly during the
  summer-autumn rice season, water is often insufficient to irrigate the entire
  rice production areas, and thus restricting rice productivity significantly.
  In this study, a coupled hydrological-irrigation optimization modelling system
  is developed to optimize irrigation strategies for a typical rice irrigation
  system in Central Vietnam. The model consists of a fully distributed
  hydrologic model, which simulates the inflow to a reservoir, and an irrigation
  model, which optimizes the rice irrigation technology, i.e. Alternate Wetting
  and Drying (AWD) or Continuous Flooding (CF), irrigation schedule and cropping
  area under given water constraints. Irrigation strategies are derived based on
  different initial reservoir water levels at the beginning of the cropping
  season as well as different maximum water releases. The simulation results
  show that the initial level of water in the reservoir is crucial: Water levels
  of less than 90% do not provide sufficient water to irrigate the entire
  cropping area, whereas a level of 70% restricts the cropping area to 75%. AWD
  is able to reduce the water input, ranging from 4% to 10%. The adoption of AWD
  therefore has the potential to irrigate a larger area and may help to increase
  the profit of the farmers. However, the benefits of AWD can only be achieved
  after significant investment in the canal system and the reservoir outlet.
  Since the robustness of the optimization results (performance variability) is
  crucial for decision support, we estimated the impact of different computing
  environments on the solutions. Only limited performance variability is found,
  giving confidence in the robustness of the model for decision support."
