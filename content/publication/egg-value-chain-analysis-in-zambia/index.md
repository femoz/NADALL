abstract: "The main boundary for the analysis of quantitative data relating to the egg VC is egg 
production – from day old chicks (DOC) to table eggs. In particular, financial and economic analysis 
undertaken as part of the study focused on the egg producers as well as those who rear point of 
lay (POL) hens and sell to small and medium-scale egg producers. Also included in the analysis 
are the table eggs traders and consumers. In addition, relevant background information is 
collected and discussed in relation to other players connected to the basic chain. These include 
key inputs suppliers such as farmers growing soya beans which are a vital ingredient in 
commercial layer feed formulation. Small-scale soya producers who are participating in contract 
farming are of interest, partly because of opportunity provided to learn from experiences under 
the Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) support in Zambia. TAF funded a pilot a distribution system 
with a major egg producer to improve supply of table eggs to retailers in “high-density” (relatively 
poorer) urban communities and an out-grower scheme involving the production and supply of 
soya beans by small-scale farmers to the market leader in egg production in the country. As far as 
egg producers are concerned, the focus of the study is on “table eggs” produced from hybrid layers 
primarily for the market. Eggs produced in rural areas from “village chickens” are therefore not 
covered in this study as evidence available suggests these eggs are not marketed but are 
consumed by households or hatched for raising chicken."
