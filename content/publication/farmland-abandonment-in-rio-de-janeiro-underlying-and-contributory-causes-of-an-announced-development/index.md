abstract: Farmland abandonment is a widespread process with mixed socio-economic
  and environmental consequences. Farmland abandonment in Rio de Janeiro State
  is mainly instigated by the sugarcane industry crisis. The sugarcane crisis in
  Rio de Janeiro State affected traditional livelihoods and altered the
  environment and economy in the Norte Fluminense region (eastern part of Rio de
  Janeiro State). Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying forces
  and contributory causes of farmland abandonment in Rio de Janeiro. We
  hypothesized that since the 1970s, macroeconomic and agricultural reforms
  mediated by economic shocks had driven the farmland abandonment in Rio de
  Janeiro State. We applied an interrupted time-series analysis over sugarcane
  harvest areas, relating the years of policy reforms and economic shocks to the
  trends in sugarcane harvest areas. The results suggest that the removal of
  agricultural subsidies, macroeconomic reforms, and elimination of the supply
  quota in the sugar mills have prompted competition and favored high-input
  agroindustry. Meanwhile, the labor force migration to the higher-paying oil
  Industry exacerbated the farmland abandonment rates for the smallholders of
  Rio de Janeiro State. This paper offers a valuable contribution to scientists
  and policymakers by providing an overview of the outcomes of the policies
  implemented and how they contributed to shaping the socio-economic dynamics in
  Rio de Janeiro State.
