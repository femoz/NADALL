abstract: "In Morocco about 20 % of children under the age of 15 years are
  stunted or delayed in growth. Dietary quality is much associated with dietary
  diversity. Recent FAO/WHO recommendations emphasized food diversification
  intake to combat many nutrition related diseases. Dietary diversity is used
  for the assessment of diet quality and food security. Morocco still bears a
  heavy burden of many micronutrient deficiencies and child stunting. Stunting
  reflects chronic under nutrition and nutritional insecurity. The purpose of
  the study was to assess dietary diversity by comparing a dietary diversity
  score (DDS) and a weekly food frequency score (WFFS) and study their
  relationship to stunting in school-age children in the province of Kenitra
  (Morocco). The study was carried out in urban and rural areas of Kenitra.
  After administrative authorizations and parents’ clearance and children’s
  consent. The study team surveyed seven different schools representing all the
  principal communities of Kenitra and its region. A structured questionnaire
  composed of different items: Household demographic data, socio-economic data,
  anthropometric measurements, food and nutrition evaluation was delivered to
  get answers. A stratified random sample of 263 pupils with average age of 12.9
  ± 0.9 years including one-third from rural schools were administered a weekly
  food frequency questionnaire. A health team assessed the anthropometric
  status. Dietary diversity was appraised with two types of indices: a dietary
  diversity score (DDS) based on the number of food categories consumed over a
  week, and a weekly food frequency score (WFFS) which also takes into account
  the frequency of food intake. The DDS was significantly higher in rural than
  in urban children, whereas the WFFS was lower, in rural children owing
  primarily to less frequent intake of fruits and vegetables than in the urban
  children. Maternal level of instruction was also positively associated with a
  higher consumption of fruits and vegetables and milk, and with a higher WFFS.
  Both indices were significantly associated with stunting. The study suggested
  that diet quality is associated with height status and food diversity indices
  that take food frequency into account which may provide a better reflection of
  diet quality."
