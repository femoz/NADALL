abstract: Since independence, several development plans have been made to
  promote the milk sector in Algeria. The current conjecture, characterized by a
  decline in hydrocarbon revenues and international price volatility, makes it
  difficult for the State to honor its commitments on subsidies. Consequently,
  the idea is to think in other forms of organization that are more competitive,
  taking care in all the development factors upstream and downstream of dairy
  farming. The agricultural cooperative seems to be the most appropriate form to
  meet all these conveniences.
