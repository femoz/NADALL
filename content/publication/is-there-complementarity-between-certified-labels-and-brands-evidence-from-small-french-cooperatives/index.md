abstract: "Many quality signals—both private and public—have been used to foster
  the development of food quality in the agro-food markets: mainly brands and
  common certified labels. Previous research has typically focused on either
  brand or certified label efficiency independently, while in many instances
  both signals coexist. Agricultural products that pair brand names and
  certified labels—such as indications of origin—are indeed common: e.g.,
  Roquefort cheese, Scotch whiskeys, and most of the French wines. The objective
  of our paper is to take into account this coexistence by empirically analyzing
  the complementarity and/or substitutability that may exist between labels and
  brands. To do so, we estimate different models of adoption and an original
  multinomial probit model of complementarity that we test on a database of the
  quality-signaling strategies from 993 small French cooperatives. Our main
  result shows that there is a clear interaction effect between brand and
  certified label signal strategies, but it is a substitution effect rather than
  a complementary one."
