abstract: The COVID-19 health crisis prompted some governments to modify their
  food trade policies, tending to restrict exports and facilitate imports. These
  restrictive measures can, although global stocks are high, drive up food
  prices, hurt incomes and exacerbate world hunger. Algeria has taken steps to
  build strategic stocks which currently appear to be satisfactory, but which
  may face future challenges due to price volatility in the world market. For
  the milk sector, we are proposing a reflection to redirect the price subsidy
  policy towards a policy based on targeting. This will involve the creation of
  integrated production hubs, support segmentation according to farm sizes, and
  a preference for hardy species according to bioclimatic levels. We also
  propose the organization of marketing circuits and the popularization of
  professional organization so that breeders have a force of proposals in case
  of crises
