abstract: The current agrofood system holds much of the responsibility for
  environment degradation (e.g., biodiversity loss, water resources depletion
  and/or pollution, land degradation, and climate change). Therefore there is a
  need for a genuine transition toward sustainability in which sustainable diets
  can play a key role. The Mediterranean diet is widely considered as a
  sustainable diet model. Many studies show that adherence to the Mediterranean
  diet can bring about environmental, social, and economic benefits besides
  health-nutrition benefits. This chapter provides an overview on the
  environmental benefits of the Mediterranean diet with a particular reference
  to environmental footprints (e.g., water footprint, ecological footprint, and
  carbon footprint). It shows that, in general, the better is adherence to the
  Mediterranean diet, the lower is the water, land, and energy use and
  greenhouse gas emissions. It also highlights that the Mediterranean diet can
  play an important role in biodiversity conservation, food wastage reduction,
  and climate change mitigation.
