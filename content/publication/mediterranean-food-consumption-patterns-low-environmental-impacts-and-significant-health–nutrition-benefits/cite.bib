      health-nutrition benefits.

AB  - The Mediterranean dietary patterns comply better with recommended nutrient and 
      micronutrient intakes. The Mediterranean diet (MD) was associated with reduced 
      mortality and lower risk for metabolic chronic diseases. It has also low ecological, 
      carbon and water footprints due to its high share of plant-based foods. In fact, the 
      share of plant-based dietary energy is higher in the Mediterranean than in Northern 
      Europe. The Mediterranean hotspot is a major centre of plant and crop diversity. 
      Mediterranean people gather and consume about 2300 plant species. This review paper 
      aims at highlighting the nutrition-health benefits of the MD and analysing the main 
      environmental impacts of the Mediterranean food consumption patterns. There is a 
      growing body of scientific evidence that the MD has significant health-nutrition 
      benefits and low environmental footprints, so there is urgent need to reverse the 
      ongoing erosion of the MD heritage and to promote it as a sustainable diets model.
