abstract: The Mediterranean dietary patterns comply better with recommended
  nutrient and micronutrient intakes. The Mediterranean diet (MD) was associated
  with reduced mortality and lower risk for metabolic chronic diseases. It has
  also low ecological, carbon and water footprints due to its high share of
  plant-based foods. In fact, the share of plant-based dietary energy is higher
  in the Mediterranean than in Northern Europe. The Mediterranean hotspot is a
  major centre of plant and crop diversity. Mediterranean people gather and
  consume about 2300 plant species. This review paper aims at highlighting the
  nutrition–health benefits of the MD and analysing the main environmental
  impacts of the Mediterranean food consumption patterns. There is a growing
  body of scientific evidence that the MD has significant health–nutrition
  benefits and low environmental footprints, so there is urgent need to reverse
  the ongoing erosion of the MD heritage and to promote it as a sustainable
  diets model.
