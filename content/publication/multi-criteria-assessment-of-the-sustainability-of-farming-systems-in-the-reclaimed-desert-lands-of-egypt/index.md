abstract: "On newly cultivated lands in deserts as in the majority of dryland
  areas, the sustainability of agricultural systems is often debated in terms of
  socioeconomic viability and agro-ecological longevity. In these contexts,
  livestock production systems have raised controversial debates regarding their
  roles and effects in terms of sustainable development. The objective of this
  paper is to assess the level (and types) of crop-livestock integration in the
  dryland systems and whether they result in different well-being and improved
  efficiency of these agroecosystems. Using an empirical study in the newly
  reclaimed desert lands of the west part of the Nile Delta (Egypt), we proposed
  an assessment of the sustainability of the family farming systems using two
  approaches: a) multiple factor analysis and b) multi-criteria assessment. The
  multi-criteria assessment highlighted how family farm sustainability depends
  highly on the integration of livestock into the system, with technical or
  economic efficiency effects. The multiple factor analysis allowed the
  distinction of two types of farm systems in which livestock activity could be
  a source in increasing labour productivity or ensuring the viability of the
  farm in both short and long terms. So, the two approaches brought out the
  critical role of livestock in the overall efficiency of the system. However,
  factor analysis highlighted different profiles of integration and
  diversification based on-farm assets, and the multi-criteria assessment
  provided a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing aggregated indicators
  for the development of sustainable farming systems for the end-users. So these
  two methods may be complementarity to develop and assess the causal processes
  of a sustainability assessment."
