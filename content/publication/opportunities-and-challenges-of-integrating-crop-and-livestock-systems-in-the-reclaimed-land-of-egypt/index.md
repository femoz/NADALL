abstract: "The Mediterranean agriculture is constrained by high competition for
  land and water utilization. One of the challenges for farmers is to increase
  land productivity through a better use of livestock in mixed crop-livestock
  farming systems. To assess the opportunities and challenges of integrating
  crop and livestock activities in irrigated areas, a survey was conducted among
  175 small-scale farms in the West Delta desert land of Egypt in 2013/2014.
  Five regions were investigated and comprised the old reclaimed lands where
  settlers came in the 1960s, the intermediate reclaimed lands where farmers
  settled down in the 1980s, and the new reclaimed lands that were attributed to
  new farmers in the 1990s. The study highlighted two types of farmers’
  strategies: 1) diversification and specialization with focus on fruit tree
  plantation by university graduates, who had benefited from the attribution of
  around two hectares of land in the settlement program since the end of the
  1970s; and 2) diversification with emphasis on livestock by common beneficiary
  settlers from the Nile Valley, who had benefited from the attribution of one
  hectare of land since the 1990s. Graduates focusing on fruit trees
  corresponded to a strategy of developing new business activity, whereas common
  beneficiaries diversifying their farming systems through livestock
  corresponded to the need to secure a stable source of family income all year
  round. Whereas diversification appeared to be a driving force for agricultural
  development in this context, specialization could be a social and economic
  risk as graduates became more dependent on national and international markets.
  This was reflected in the perception of farmers who underlined the need to
  integrate technical, ecological, economic and social constraints in their
  decisions."
