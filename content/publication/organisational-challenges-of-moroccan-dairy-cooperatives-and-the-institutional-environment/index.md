abstract: Marketing cooperatives in developing and transition countries face
  challenges when they aim to strengthen their competitiveness. One of these
  challenges relates to improving the quality of the products delivered by their
  members. Another challenge relates to the financial sustainability of the
  cooperative, as cooperatives have to choose between paying out a surplus to
  members and retaining it in the organisation. As these problems are not
  specific to one organisation, and public policies often affect the scope for
  individual cooperatives, we explore how the institutional environment helps in
  reducing those challenges. We present a case study of the Moroccan dairy
  industry, exploring how the institutional environment has affected the
  development and performance of dairy cooperatives. The methods used were
  in-depth semi-structured interviews within six dairy cooperatives. Findings
  point to the weak coordination between the main value chain actors. We also
  found a lack of financial instruments to facilitate investments in adequate
  quality assurance equipment and capacity development programs. Finally, we
  found a perceived lack of support from state policies vis-as-vis smallholders
  and their cooperatives.
