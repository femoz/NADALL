abstract: The dairy subsidy policy (for production, collection, and processing)
  has allowed access for small livestock farmers in the Sétif wilaya to the
  value chain of the sector. This policy was consolidated by a ministerial
  authorization, in 2009, allowing the collection of milk from all farms
  (approved or not). This article provides a demonstration from a survey of
  about one hundred breeders in this region. The results show that the subsidies
  of the National Office of the milk (ONIL) allowed the increase of the number
  of breeders contracted with the dairies. This increase in numbers has been
  accompanied by an increase in the bargaining power of collectors with farmers
  and dairies (through their collection strategy) who have a very low level of
  influence on the choices of dairy farmers.
