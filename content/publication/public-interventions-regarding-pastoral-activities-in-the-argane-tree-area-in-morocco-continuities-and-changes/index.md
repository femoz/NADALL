abstract: The historical context of public policies in Morocco introduces the
  analysis of the public projects in the argane tree area in Morocco. The study
  is devoted mainly to pastoral and livestock components of these policies. The
  complexity and diversity of land status and the social and cultural
  organization (agdal, mouchâa) are sum up as local characteristics of the
  argane tree area. To address the economic, social and environmental complex
  challenges faced by agriculture, the Moroccan government has implemented the
  Green Morocco Plan, (GMP) a rather innovative and proactive agricultural
  policy. Regarding the mountains and oasis hinterland, the GMP has created a
  2nd Pillar dedicated to solidarity and small holders’ agriculture. The
  policies for livestock and pastoralism are analyzed through specific projects
  undertaken by the GMP with a special focus on their implementing conditions. A
  first observation is that the 2nd Pillar takes up rather systematically the
  strategic guidelines for rural development and the principles implemented by
  public policies in other countries like France (local products) or
  international organizations (defined by the Millenium Development Goals).
  Besides, they are still driven largely by dominant mental models based on
  competitiveness and a top - down vision of innovation which could be hardly
  compatible with principles of solidarity displayed for this Pillar. Meanwhile,
  the aims of the projects are very wide, and their elaborate operational
  objectives are generally not specified. Tensions between the major national
  objectives and the power relationships within each territory are real
  difficulties in defining and achieving these objectives with the likely
  pressures of the most influential players to defend their short-term
  interests. Some initiatives taken by local actors have nevertheless begun to
  be addressed by public authorities in a more participatory way. Strengthening
  experimental design, research and geographic information to better document
  the potential of each area, to know the markets and taking account of local
  organizational practices, know-how on land management would be likely to
  improve the effectiveness of these policies.
