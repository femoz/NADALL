abstract: "Crop diversification is considered as a major lever to increase the
  sustainability of arable farming systems, allowing reduced inputs (irrigation
  water, pesticides, fertilizers), increasing the heterogeneity of habitat
  mosaics, or reducing yield gap associated with too frequent returns of the
  same species. To free up paths of collective action, this article highlights
  obstacles to crop diversification, existing at various levels of the value
  chains. We used a threefold approach: (i) a cross-cutting analysis of
  impediments to the development of 11 diversifying crops (5 species of grain
  legumes, alfalfa, flax, hemp, linseed, mustard, sorghum), based on published
  documents and on 30 interviews of stakeholders in French value chains; (ii) a
  detailed study (55 semi-structured surveys, including 39 farmers) of three
  value chains: pea and linseed for animal feed, hemp for insulation and
  biomaterials; and (iii) a bibliometric analysis of the technical journals and
  websites (180 articles) to characterize the nature of information diffused to
  farmers. We highlight that the development of minor crops is hindered by a
  socio-technical lock-in in favor of the dominant species (wheat, rapeseed,
  maize, etc.). We show for the first time that this lock-in is characterized by
  strongly interconnected impediments, occurring at every link of the value
  chains, such as lack of availability of improved varieties and methods of
  plant protection, scarcity of quantified references on crop successions,
  complexity of the knowledge to be acquired by farmers, logistical constraints
  to harvest collection, and difficulties of coordination within the emerging
  value chains. On the basis of this lock-in analysis, that could concern other
  European countries, the article proposes levers aimed at encouraging actors to
  incorporate a greater diversity of crops into their productive systems:
  adaptation of standards and labelling, better coordination between
  stakeholders to fairly share added value within value chains, and combination
  of genetic, agronomic, technological, and organizational innovations."
