Dairy production results from varied production models from one country to another and is based on animal species with different characteristics.&amp;amp;nbsp; It has increased dramatically in recent decades. The future development of milk production is subject to various constraints that question the best ways of achieving sustainability. In this context, the first part of this article presents the dynamics of the dairy sector in terms of consumption and production in various major geographical areas. The second part deals with the sustainability of the dairy sector, mainly in developing countries, through a selection of three themes: i- the social dimension (often forgotten) and the need to mainstream gender issues; ii- the sustainable use of water resources in Morocco and India, chosen to illustrate two contrasting situations; iii- biodiversity and the essential contribution of non-bovine milks to local development. The third part recalls that international trade exchanges make it possible for many countries with a deficit in milk to meet domestic demand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={3}, journal={INRAE Productions Animales}, author={SRAÏRI, Mohamed Taher and CHATELLIER, Vincent and CORNIAUX, Christian and FAYE, Bernard and AUBRON, Claire and HOSTIOU, Nathalie and SAFA, Alejandra and BOUHALLAB, Saïd and LORTAL, Sylvie}, year={2019}, month={Sep.}, pages={339–358} }
