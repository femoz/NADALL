abstract: In recent decades, Vietnam has experienced an incredible increase of
  total factor productivity (TFP) in rice production. This has allowed the
  country to rise to become one of the largest rice producers worldwide.
  Nevertheless, despite these achievements, there are strong signs of a TFP
  slowdown in Vietnam in recent years, raising concerns about the future
  development of rice production and appropriate policy measures. We have
  analyzed the technical efficiency of rice production in the delta of the Vu
  Gia Thu Bon river basin in Central Vietnam, considering the different rice
  seasons and the spatial distribution of efficiency scores. We applied
  stochastic frontier analyses with a simultaneous (one-step) estimation of the
  parameters of exogenous effects on technical efficiency (TE). We have shown
  that TE in this region is basically impacted by the scale of production, by
  fragmentation of the farm and also by the exposition to salinity intrusion
  risks. The latter factor has never been explicitly included in former
  technical efficiency studies of rice production in Vietnam. There is a
  pertinent need for policies targeting farm fragmentation and enlargement of
  the scale of rice production. The spatial distribution of TE shows that
  salinity intrusion and the inherent irrigation management problems caused to
  farmers is a serious negative impacting factor. Adaptation measures on water
  management in the basin, as well as related to the introduction of salinity
  resistant rice varieties should be addressed urgently in the region to
  increase efficiency in rice production.
