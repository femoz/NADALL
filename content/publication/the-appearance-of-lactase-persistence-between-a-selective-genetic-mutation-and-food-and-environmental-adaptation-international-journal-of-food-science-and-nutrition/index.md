abstract: Approximately 70 % of the world population is lactose intolerant,
  whereas the rest has been able to preserve an important activity of lactase.
  This lactase persistence results from a genetic mutation, which the mechanism
  is still not clearly established. The decline of the activity of lactase
  depends on the ethnic and geographical origin; this disparity of lactase
  persistence in the various regions of the globe suggests that this mutation
  benefited of a very important positive natural selection. It can be influenced
  by the ancestral consumption of milk and dairy products which allowed them to
  have an adaptation to a diet rich in lactose. The lactase persistence also
  represents an element of survival in front of environmental conditions. The
  appearance of lactase persistence remains not well clarified, other studies
  will be necessary to strengthen these results.
