abstract: "Mediterranean livestock farming systems have evolved to adapt to
  current and future pressures, including strong demographic growth and
  urbanization in the coastal zone, greater competition for land and water, and
  a big shift in the hinterland where farming activities are hardly maintained.
  We aim to explore future pathways for integrated crop-livestock systems in
  South and North Mediterranean countries to identify potential sustainable
  increases in efficiency and adaptability of resource utilization. The research
  was conducted in three countries, Egypt, France and Morocco, through case
  studies in a gradient of socio-ecological contexts, from favorable (plains and
  irrigated lands) to harsher ones (mountains, rain-fed areas). We mobilized
  farm surveys and monitoring, open-ended interviews, databases and previous
  studies. Based on a transversal analysis at the local level, we identified two
  main trends and five archetypical systems: (1) a centrifugal trend of
  specialization, towards cash crops or dairy herds in favorable areas, and
  pastoral system for meat production in harsher environments, and (2) a
  centripetal trend of diversification based on mixed crop-livestock systems in
  irrigation areas and agro-pastoral livestock-crop systems in intermediate
  rain-fed areas. The analysis showed an overwhelming antagonism between social
  vulnerability and ecological efficiency. Crop and livestock integration
  reduced the risk of biodiversity loss and low environmental efficiency
  observed in specialized systems, but mixed systems were more socially
  vulnerable. Those results call for dedicated rural development policies that
  favor the diversification as a lever of sustainable development but taking
  into account the land fragmentation and developing higher value added products
  chains. Taking advantage of spatial mobility abilities of livestock farming at
  the regional level, promoting collective actions must be encouraged to allow a
  wider range of livestock farmers in the hinterlands to live from their
  activities."
