abstract: Couscous is a traditional dish for Moroccan population, based on wheat
  semolina and habitually consumed on Fridays and days of family reunion, its
  design is different according to the regions and according to the availability
  of the raw material (wheat, barley ...). In order to contribute to the
  reduction of malnutrition in Morocco, this study was carried out. Legumes
  including lentils have a great role in human diet, they are commonly consumed
  for their nutritive value specifically proteins and iron. Lentil is among the
  oldest and most appreciated grain legumes of the Old World. Thus, the current
  investigation aims to enhance the nutritive value of conventional Moroccan
  couscous through its preparation by incorporation of lentil semolina into its
  components. Four experimental variant proportions of grains legumes semolina
  (25, 50 and 75%) were analyzed, with couscous made of grains lentil semolina
  only (100%L) and of grains wheat semolina only (0%L) as control. From
  nutritive point of view, the higher contents of proteins, iron and potassium
  were found in couscous with addition of 75% of lentil semolina. In effect, the
  lower content was recorded for conventional Moroccan couscous, and more the
  percentage of incorporation increased more its content of proteins, iron and
  potassium increased. Contrariwise, more the percentage increased more
  carbohydrates and sodium contents decreased. From technological point of view,
  the addition of lentil semolina at 25% presented the closest results to the
  technological parameters of conventional Moroccan couscous. Microbiological
  tests revealed that couscous of wheat semolina only is a favorable environment
  for the growth of microorganisms. The nutritional value of lentils and their
  technological characteristics are useful in increasing nutritional and
  technological value of fortified conventional Moroccan couscous.
