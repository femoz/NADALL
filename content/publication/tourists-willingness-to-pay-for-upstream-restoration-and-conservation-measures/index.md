abstract: Continuous wildlife loss worldwide and in the Masai Mara National
  Reserve in Kenya in particular motivated this study. Degradation of ecosystem
  services in the Mara basin is a cause of increasing pressure on the wildlife
  of the reserve. Wildlife tourists in the downstream area of the basin are
  beneficiaries of ecosystem services, particularly stream flow and water
  quality, provided in the upstream water catchment. This study aimed to
  estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) of wildlife tourists to cofinance
  conservation and restoration measures in the upstream of the Mara River Basin.
  The contingent valuation method was used with a valuation scenario framed in a
  payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme. The relationship between WTP and
  several socioeconomic variables was captured by an ordered logistic regression
  model. The mean WTP was estimated at US$41.6 (KES 4314.8), with a potential
  annual revenue of over $US 3.5 million alone from tourists staying inside the
  reserve. This study contributes to clarifying the feasibility of a PES scheme
  in the Mara River Basin complementing former studies concerned with the
  willingness to accept conservation and restoration measures in the upstream of
  the basin. The study closes an important knowledge gap and paves the way for
  an institutional solution enabling PES implementation in the basin.
