abstract="Good agricultural practices (GAP) are norms and procedures developed to obtain agricultural products in a sustainable way. The specific GAP for dairy farms are good dairy practices (GDP) which objective is sustainable milk production. Animal products obtained with environmentally responsible practices, joined with increased awareness for animal well-being, concern modern consumers. This fact challenges the livestock sector and opens opportunities for products from animals maintained under high welfare standards. The measures to achieve high states of animal welfare are complementary with GDP. Animals that live in enhanced environmental conditions, with optimal health status, reach higher wellness and have a better performance. Therefore, animal well-being is strongly related with efficiency and profitability in dairy production. In the case study area of Italva, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, the traditional milking practices of small dairy farmers, the low milk yield, the environmental conditions, the degradation of natural resources, and poor infrastructure hamper good quality and a high and constant milk production. The potentials and constraints of small milk producers of Italva to adopt GDP through animal welfare concepts are analyzed to support farmers to achieve sustainability, to increase production, and to have access to broader markets and fairer prices for high-quality milk.",
