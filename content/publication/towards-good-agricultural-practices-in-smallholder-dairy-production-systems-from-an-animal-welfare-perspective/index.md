abstract: Good agricultural practices (GAP) are norms and procedures developed
  to obtain agricultural products in a sustainable way. The specific GAP for
  dairy farms are good dairy practices (GDP) which objective is sustainable milk
  production. Animal products obtained with environmentally responsible
  practices, joined with increased awareness for animal well-being, concern
  modern consumers. This fact challenges the livestock sector and opens
  opportunities for products from animals maintained under high welfare
  standards. The measures to achieve high states of animal welfare are
  complementary with GDP. Animals that live in enhanced environmental
  conditions, with optimal health status, reach higher wellness and have a
  better performance. Therefore, animal well-being is strongly related with
  efficiency and profitability in dairy production. In the case study area of
  Italva, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, the traditional milking practices of
  small dairy farmers, the low milk yield, the environmental conditions, the
  degradation of natural resources, and poor infrastructure hamper good quality
  and a high and constant milk production. The potentials and constraints of
  small milk producers of Italva to adopt GDP through animal welfare concepts
  are analyzed to support farmers to achieve sustainability, to increase
  production, and to have access to broader markets and fairer prices for
  high-quality milk.
